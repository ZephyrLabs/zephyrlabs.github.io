<h1>Getting started with clustering</h1>
<h2>part 1:</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>Its always has been my wish to build my own SBC cluster, and its finally a reality!
in this article I'll explain what were my steps to setup and build my own super powered SBC cluster</p>
<h3>Getting started:</h3>
<p>to build a cluster we need to select our choice of processing media and 
various components to interconnect the system.
I chose the VIM3 as the brains of the operation/s</p>
<p><img alt="vim3" src="vim3.jpg" title="vim3" /></p>
<p>I've been using the VIM3 for about 2 years now, and it has been running quite reliably,
I'll be using the VIM3s in a 4+1 configuration where 1 VIM3 controls the other 4 VIM3s
the net resources in this cluster (excuding the master node) is:</p>
<ul>
<li>24 cores</li>
<li>12 GB of RAM</li>
</ul>
<p>this will allow us to do a wide variety of distributed computing tasks</p>

<p>but what is a cluster without the literal fabric that connects it all ?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The essentials:</h3>
<p><img alt="interconnect" src="essentials.png" title="essentials" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The four horsemen of connecting it all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the 4 main things we need for connecting it all together include:</p>
<ol>
<li>TPlink 8 port gigabit ethernet switch</li>
<li>generic 6 port wall charger</li>
<li>Ethernet cables</li>
<li>USB-C cables</li>
</ol>
<p>the gigabit ethernet switch is the literal bread and butter of the entire operation, 
allowing high speed communication between all the various nodes connected to it.</p>
<p>the charger is a branded version of the generic HDS-HDD10T charger, 
it provides 60w of power distributed among 6 individual USB ports, 
allowing us to power up the system without any power deficiency</p>
<p>the cables also play a vital role as they help to connect everything together
the USB cables were plain braided USB-C to USB-A and
the ethernet cables were 1 meter long patch cables which were CAT6 compliant.</p>
<h3>Building the cluster:</h3>
<p>except the master node, each node was fitted with a small heatsink to help dissipate heat, 
and was stacked with pairs of M2 standoffs</p>
<p><img alt="stack_up" src="stack_up.png" title="stacked up node" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>putting it together piece by piece</p>
</blockquote>
<p>all such nodes were given standoffs and stacked up to finally give a tower of SBCs</p>
<p><img alt="main_cluster" src="main_cluster.png" title="main cluster" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the tower of power</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the nodes are well spaced to allow for good airflow during passive cooling.</p>
<p>the top most node which is the master node which controls all the other 
nodes is fitted with a passive heatsink from khadas, and acts as the 
endcap for the standoff heads and also gives the extra necessary cooling 
for the master node which will have to manage all other devices</p>
<h3>setting up some initial software...</h3>
<p>for the cluster we need to setup all the nodes to run linux, the simple 
approach I took to do this seamlessly is using <a href="https://docs.khadas.com/vim3/Krescue.html">Krescue</a></p>
<p>one node at a time can be fitted with a thumbdrive containing krescue and 
the necessary firmware file and connected to the computer to open up the 
krescue web console and flash the firmware</p>
<p><img alt="krescue_web" src="krescue_web.png" title="krescue web client" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>look ma, krescue is on my browser!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>my choice of firmware was the stock Arch image install via krescue scripts, 
running the mainline kernel, this would mean I'd be getting the up to date 
software and latest optimizations available, kudos to @Artem from khadas 
for creating these amazing scripts!</p>
<p>Arch linux is very lightweight, fast to boot, and is very vanilla (apart 
from being a bit difficult to setup if you are an linux beginner)</p>
<h3>cable management:</h3>
<p>much work was done to organize the extra lengthy cables I used here, if 
you were to attempt this you could get away with some smaller patch cables 
for less of a mess.</p>
<p>extensive usage of twist ties and braiding was done to maintain the 
seamless flow of the cables</p>
<h3>what's next ?:</h3>
<p>in the next part I'll be exploring some of the software I used to setup 
the cluster this includes things like passwordless SSH functionality, 
various software for running code with the power of all the clusters etc. </p>
<h2>Part 2:</h2>
<h3>setting up the software:</h3>
<p>our first thing on the agenda of software management will be to make sure 
we have SSH keys enabled for each of the nodes so that we can have 
passwordless access to each node from the master node.</p>
<p>we first want to figure out which IP address of the various nodes, but 
since we don't know one node from another we want to change the host name 
of the cluster on the master node</p>
<p>we first power up the master node (the one on top with the bigger heatsink , 
and change the host name, this can be done with 
<code>sudo nano /etc/hostname</code> and changing the default name to whatever we 
prefer, I named my cluster <strong>orchid</strong> </p>
<p>after that we can reboot the vim and power up all the nodes and login to
my router to see the attached devices and their various names, its much 
easier to spot the master node among the other nodes, since I initially 
know the IP address of my master node from previously sshing into it, I 
only need to remember the IP address of the other nodes</p>
<p>usually I would need to setup a static IP address but since the image was
preconfigured to set its own IP, I didn't meddle with that.</p>
<p>I opened up a corresponding number of SSH terminals to my master node from 
my main computer equal to the number of other nodes on the network (which 
in my case was 5 other nodes)</p>
<p>after that I ran <code>ssh-keygen</code> and gave enter without any data input to
make sure I would have a passwordless entry.</p>
<p>after that I run <code>ssh-copy-id &lt;ip-of-a-node&gt;</code> for each node on each 
terminal after which I run <code>ssh &lt;ip-of-a-node&gt;</code> on each terminal for each 
node and run updates (<code>sudo pacman -Syu</code>) to bring all 
the nodes up to date</p>
<p>we will first install <code>mpich</code> and <code>python3-mpi4py</code> from the pacman package 
manager (<code>sudo pacman -S mpich python3-mpi4py</code>), this will allow us to 
run commands simulatneously when needed in the future like for example 
updates and necessary packages etc.</p>
<p>and just like that the initial software setup is complete for the cluster.
optionally you can set individual hostnames for each of the various nodes.</p>
<h3>What's next ?:</h3>
<p>In the next part I'll be running some example code to show the cluster 
using its computational resource. we can compare these numbers to show how 
fast it is compared to other various devices like an Individual VIM and 
another Rasberry pi cluster.</p>
