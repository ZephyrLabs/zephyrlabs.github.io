<h1>Surveillant</h1>
<p><strong>A highly customizeable dashboard on your desktop</strong></p>
<p><img alt="surveillant" src="surveillant.png" title="surveillant" /></p>
<p>The surveillant project is an ambitious idea to make an 
all in one system mangement utility, that is compact enough
to fit on your desktop.</p>
<p>the principle of the project to have a dedicated monitoring
that can operate independant of your actual system, as well 
as act like a middleman when you need to interact with it as well</p>
<p>the project has 2 parts to it, mainly the physical 
dashboard as seen above, as well as the software 
which can be customized to run on other modified platforms</p>
<p>for my usage I built it with a khadas's VIM3 and their TS050 touchscreen
and the enclosure which is a customized version of a handheld case
which is 3D printed </p>

<p>now the software framework for this project is based on the 
principle of sending the data collected over the local network
for displaying on the dashboard</p>

<blockquote>
<p>multi client and host system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the system of having a dedicated server and client is more efficient
that previous methods of data collection, which involved more
heavy services like mpich to collect and send the data which
was quite bulky</p>
<p>this newer system has minimal system load and can be considered to have
negligible resource usage during run time.</p>
<p><img alt="node view" src="nodepanel.png" title="node view" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>0% cpu usage during idle and still fetching data, efficent!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This client can be ported to other platforms with ease, I've documented
the requirements for building a custom client in the github documentation
so if you require a modified version of the client server, its possible
to create one from scratch!</p>
<p>the project is completely open source and available on github to download
and try out!</p>
