# My personal view of the Khadas Tone 2 pro:

## my personal notes:

## first impressions:
___
### audio perspective:
* the beats are crisp, well bought out, clear mids, highs, and lows
* even the slightest background notes are well distinguishable
* no stuttering, clicks, or pops
___
### hardware perspective:
* solid build quailty, and a well designed metal chassis
* a smooth rotary knob, with little to no play 
* rubberised bottom pad, keeps it stable, prevents it from sliding on the table
___
### software perspective:
* the implemented software plays along well with the rotary knob
* simple to use, and memorise the color patterns on the RGB wheel (atleast for me)
___
### things I need to investigate..:
* entire tone 2 heats up after about ~ 1 hour of continous use
(the metal chassis aids in cooling the device, so it doesn't overheat)

* when placed flat on the table at about 50 cm from the eyes, the RGB ring isn't particularly viewable, and needs to be placed at a slight angle with the relative body position to be completely seen,
however it isn't much of an issue as after the modes are well memorised, and modes can be changed without having to necessarily look at the tone (muscle memory)

Overall: quite impressed with the performance, waiting to do long term testing to determine the stronger and weaker points of use, but has already exceeded expectations :)
